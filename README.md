# Books API Go

A RESTful API built with Go (Gin) for managing books, featuring Swagger documentation, Kafka event streaming, and Redis caching. This project was originally requested as part of a job application coding task, which I've kept as a showcase of my Go development skills and understanding of modern backend technologies.

## Technologies Used

- Go (Gin Framework)
- PostgreSQL
- Redis for caching
- Kafka for event streaming
- Swagger for API documentation
- Docker (for local development)
